"The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate knowledge of creating 
a class with object methods, instantiate multiple objects of the 
created class, and then call the object methods from the main 
program method.  Additionally, this lab requires knowledge of the 
GUI input output and string to number conversion."

TLDR: This program does math and shows off my skills. Enjoy!
